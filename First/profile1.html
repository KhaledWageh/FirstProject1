<u><h1>What is Energy?</h1></u>
<h3>Scientists define energy as the ability to do work. Modern civilization is possible because people have learned how to change energy from one form to another and then use it to do work.</h3>
<h3>Also in physics, energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. Energy is a conserved quantityâ€”the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed.</h3>
